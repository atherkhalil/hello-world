# hello-world
My first repository for learning GitHub.
I am a 19 yr old Software Engineering student with a lot of passion for learning new technologies and enhancing my knowledge of the computer science field. I believe in life long learning. I am starting to learn GitHub so i can work collaboratively on different projects to sharpen my skills and learn to apply my knowledge.
